# Magic Lambda MIME

Magic Lambda MIME give you the ability to parse and create MIME messages from Hyperlambda.
It contains the following slots.

* __[mime.parse]__ - Parses a MIME message, and returns it as a lambda object
* __[.mime.parse]__ - Parses a native MimeEntity for you, and returns it as a lambda object (not for usage directly from Hyperlambda code)
* __[mime.create]__ - Creates a MIME message for you, and returns the entire message as text, being the MIME entity
* __[.mime.create]__ - Creates a MIME message for you, and returns it as a native MimeEntity object (not for usage directly from Hyperlambda code)
* __[pgp.keys.private.import]__ - Imports an ASCII armored private PGP key bundle, in addition to any public keys found in the bundle
* __[pgp.keys.public.import]__ - Imports an ASCII armored public PGP key bundle

**Notice** - The PGP related slots above are currently in BETA implementation, and their API might change
in a future version of Magic.

## Parsing MIME messages

Below is an example of how parsing a MIME message might look like.

```
// Actual message
.msg:@"MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
        boundary=""XXXXboundary text""

This is a multipart message in MIME format.

--XXXXboundary text
Content-Type: text/plain

this is the body text
--XXXXboundary text
Content-Type: text/plain;

this is another body text
--XXXXboundary text--"

// Parsing the above message
mime.parse:x:@.msg
```

After evaluating the above, you'll end up with something resembling the following.

```
mime.parse
   entity:multipart/mixed
      headers
         MIME-Version:1.0
      entity:text/plain
         content:this is the body text
      entity:text/plain
         content:this is another body text
```

Notice how the slot creates a tree structure, perfectly resembling your original MIME message. It will also take care of
MIME headers for you, adding these into a **[headers]** collection, on a per message basis, depending upon whether or not
your message actually contains headers or not.

The **[.mime.parse]** semantically works identically, except it requires as its input a raw `MimeEntity` object from MimeKit.
The **[.mime.parse]** slot can _only be invoked from C#_, since it starts with a _"."_.

## Creating a mime message

This slot is logically the exact opposite of the **[mime.parse]** slot, and can take (almost) the exact same input as
its sibling produces as output. Below is an example.

```
mime.create
   entity:multipart/mixed
      entity:text/plain
         content:this is the body text
      entity:text/plain
         content:this is another body text
```

Which of course wil result in something resembling the following after evaluation.

```
mime.create:@"MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
        boundary=""XXXXboundary text""

This is a multipart message in MIME format.

--XXXXboundary text
Content-Type: text/plain

this is the body text
--XXXXboundary text
Content-Type: text/plain;

this is another body text
--XXXXboundary text--"
```

The **[.mime.create]** slot, will semantically do the exact same thing, but instead of returning a piece of text,
being the MIME message, it will produce a raw `MimeEntity` that it returns to caller. This slot is used internally
when the _"magic.lambda.mail"_ project constructs emails to send over an SMTP connection for instance. This slot
can also only be invoked from C# since it starts with a period (.) as its name.

## PGP Cryptography

**Notice** - These parts of the project is currently in BETA implementation, and the API might change in
a future version of Magic.

This project also supports encrypting, and cryptographically signing MIME messages, in addition to verifying signed
messages. To cryptographically sign a MIME message with your private PGP key, you can use something such as follows.

```
mime.create
   entity:text/plain
      sign:@"-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- ...... etc"
         password:your-pgp-key-password-here
      content:Foo bar
```

To encrypt a message you could do something such as follows.

```
mime.create
   entity:text/plain
      encrypt:@"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- ..... etc"
      content:Foo bar
```

You can encrypt and sign the message in one go, by adding both a private **[sign]** key and its password,
in addition to a public encryption key, using **[encrypt]**. If you wish to encrypt the same message for
multiple recipients, you can add a collection of public PGP keys that will be used to encrypt the message,
such as the following illustrates.

```
mime.create
   entity:text/plain
      encrypt
         .:@"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- ..... etc, key 1"
         .:@"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- ..... etc, key 2"
      content:Foo bar
```

**Notice** - Due to an API flaw in MimeKit, and how it looks up private PGP keys during parsing end decrypting
of MIME messages, the project does not support _decrypting_ of messages yet. Once MimeKit implements alternative
PGP key storages, or at least hooks to supply your own custom storage, not tied to Gnu Privacy Guard, we might
reconsider and support decrypting of MIME messages.

## Importing public and private PGP keys

Notice, these slots expects a PGP key bundle, either private or public, and will unwrap each public and private
key found in the bundle, and invoke your **[.lambda]** callback once for each key found in the bundle. This
callback will be given the fingerprint, ID, ids, etc for each key in your bundle. Usage is something as follows.

```
pgp.keys.public.import:@"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- ..... etc"
   .lambda
      lambda2hyper:x:.
      log.info:x:-
```

The API for importing private keys is the exact same as for importing public keys.
